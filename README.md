<b>Web scraping</b> is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves making HTTP requests to a website, parsing the HTML or XML content, and then extracting the required information. This is commonly done using programming languages like Python with libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Scrapy.

Basic Steps in Web Scraping
Send an HTTP Request: Fetch the web page you want to scrape using HTTP methods (like GET).
Parse the HTML Content: Convert the HTML content into a format that can be easily navigated and searched.
Extract Data: Locate and extract the data you need from the parsed HTML.
Store Data: Save the extracted data into a format of your choice (e.g., CSV, JSON, database).
